Sign in, Sign up and form with registration. <br>
The app can be run by creating a local host in three simple steps <br>
STEP 1 <br>
Download XAMPP using the link provided - https://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/8.1.2/xampp-windows-x64-8.1.2-0-VS16-installer.exe <br>
(The above link is for windows, for Mac or linux please go the website - apachefriends.org/index.html) <br>
and then install XAMPP in local disk c:/ <br> 
and then run XAMPP and run - 'Apache' and 'MySql'. <br>
STEP 2 <br>
Copy the .php files provided in the php folder and paste it inside the htdocs folder which is inside the xampp folder which is in localdisk c:/ <br>
Now copy the 'form' folder as a whole into the 'data' folder which is inside 'mysql' folder which is indside 'xampp' folder which is in localdisk c:/ <br>
STEP 3 <br>
Open your preferred browser and type in "localhost/login.php". The app is set and ready to function. Simple as that. :) <br>
Note: Remember XAMPP must be up and running for the localhost to work and make sure to run MySql and Apache inside XAMPP. <br>
If you want to check the database and tables and verify if the data is being stored in the database, you may click 'Admin' next to 'MySql' in XAMPP Control panel. <br>
Hope the app will work without any errors. <br>
Thank you. <br>
<br>
PS: I have provided screenshots of xampp, url, and other things in order to avoid any confusion regarding operation of this app.
