The app can be run by creating a local host in three simple steps
STEP 1
Download XAMPP using the link provided - https://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/8.1.2/xampp-windows-x64-8.1.2-0-VS16-installer.exe
(The above link is for windows, for Mac or linux please go the website - apachefriends.org/index.html)
and then install XAMPP in local disk c:/
and then run XAMPP and run - 'apache' and 'mySQL'
STEP 2
Copy the .php files provided in the php folder and paste it inside the htdocs folder which is inside the xampp folder which is in localdisk c:/
Now copy the 'form' folder as a whole into the 'data' folder which is inside 'mysql' folder which is indside 'xampp' folder which is in localdisk c:/
STEP 3
Open your preferred browser and type in "localhost/login.php". The app is set and ready to function. Simple as that. :)
Note: Remember XAMPP must be up and running for the localhost to work and make sure to run MySql and Apache inside XAMPP.
If you want to check the database and tables and verify if the data is being stored in the database, you may click 'Admin' next to 'MySql' in XAMPP Control panel.
Hope the app will work without any errors.
Thank you. 

PS: I have provided screenshots of xampp, url, and other things in order to avoid any confusion regarding operation of this app.
